The answer: from 0 to 4 in both cases.

for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );
That can be easily deducted from the algorithm of for:

Execute once i = 0 before everything (begin).
Check the condition i < 5
If true – execute the loop body alert(i), and then i++
The increment i++ is separated from the condition check (2). That’s just another statement.

The value returned by the increment is not used here, so there’s no difference between i++ and ++i.
