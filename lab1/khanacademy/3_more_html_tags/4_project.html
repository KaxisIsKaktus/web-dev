        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Season the beaten eggs well with salt and pepper. Heat the oil and butter in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat until the butter has melted and is foaming.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pour the eggs into the pan, tilt the pan ever so slightly from one side to another to allow the eggs to swirl and cover the surface of the pan completely. Let the mixture cook for about 20 seconds then scrape a line through the middle with a spatula.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tilt the pan again to allow it to fill back up with the runny egg. Repeat once or twice more until the egg has just set.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> At this point you can fill the omelette with whatever you like – some grated cheese, sliced ham, fresh herbs, sautéed mushrooms or smoked salmon all work well. Scatter the filling over the top of the omelette and fold gently in half with the spatula. Slide onto a plate to serve.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Bring a pan of lightly salted water to the boil. Add the broccoli and boil for 1 min 30 secs, or until tender. Drain and set aside. Cook the spaghetti following pack instructions, then drain, reserving a ladleful of cooking water.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Heat the oil in a large frying pan, add the garlic clove and fry over a low heat for 2 mins. Remove with a slotted spoon and discard, leaving the flavoured oil.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the tomatoes to the pan and fry over a medium heat for 5 mins, or until beginning to soften and turn juicy. Stir through the prawns and cook for 2 mins, or until turning pink. Add the harissa and lemon zest, stirring to coat.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Toss the cooked spaghetti and pasta water through the prawns and harissa. Stir through the broccoli, season to taste and serve.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Don’t allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.</p>
